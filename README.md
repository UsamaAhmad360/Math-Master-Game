🚀 How to Deploy with GitHub Pages

Push your project to a GitHub repository.

In your repo, go to Settings → Pages.

Under Source, select main (or whichever branch you’re using) and /root folder (or /docs if using docs folder).

Save.

Visit the URL: https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/ → e.g. the link above.

This works because GitHub Pages will serve your existing index.html (or HTML files) as is.
